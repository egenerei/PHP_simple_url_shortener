# PHP URL Shortener

This project is a simple PHP-based URL shortener that allows users to input long URLs and receive a shortened version, which redirects to the original URL when accessed.

## Features

- **URL Shortening**: Users can submit a long URL, which is then converted into a short URL.
- **Redirecting**: When the short URL is accessed, users are redirected to the original long URL.
- **Simple Storage**: Shortened URLs and their corresponding long URLs are stored in a text file (`urls.txt`).

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

- PHP (preferably version 7.4 or higher)
- A web server like Apache or Nginx (or use PHPâ€™s built-in server for development)
- A text file (`urls.txt`) to store the URL mappings.

## Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/php_url_shortener.git
